        Brighton Marine Services LLC SERVICE AGREEMENT
      </h1>

      <h2 className="my-4">
        TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT
      </h2>
      <p>
        There is no term to this agreement. Boat owners (hereafter known as client/boat owner)
        may cancel at any time for any reason. We ask for a minimum of 48 hours notice. Brighton
        Marine Services LLC (hereafter known as BMS or “we”) may also cancel at any time for any
        reason with 48-hour notice.
      </p>

      <h2 className="my-4">
        TERMS OF SERVICE
      </h2>

      <p>
        Below are our basic terms of service. All services provided are under our basic terms of service.
        We reserve the right to alter or modify these terms at any time in which you will be given the revised
        Agreement and your continued use of our service implies agreement with these terms. BMS agrees to
        provide cleaning services to you as per your request. The charges for our service is for the agreed
        dollar amount for a team of our employees (hereafter known as detailing members) for a maximum of a
        fixed amount of team working hours of cleaning or related services. The charge is for the amount of work
        hours reserved for you for this job and not for any specific outcome. In the event that our detailing
        team members complete the job in less time than the maximum reserved, which may sometimes be possible,
        the charge will remain the same and will not be adjusted (since this time block has been reserved for your
        job). Please note that for an average size boat under 30 feet a typical initial detailing or a waxing may
        take in excess of 8 work hours. A regular weekly or every other week cleaning in a typical boat may take in
        excess of 4 work hours. Our team members will do the best possible job they can in the time they have
        available. Since the condition of each boat will vary, it is possible that we may not be able to complete
        the job in the time available. By using our service you agree to the terms of this agreement and agree to
        pay the total due to us. All agreements are contingent upon strikes, accidents or delays beyond our control.
        Any changes to rate and/or time, be it verbal or in writing will not affect the substance of this agreement
        and all the terms herein will still apply with the new rate/time.
      </p>

      <h2 className="my-4">
        QUALITY OF SERVICE
      </h2>

      <p>
        For your convenience, and quality control, we can leave you with a checklist indicating the various services
        we provide each time we cleaned and/or detailed your boat. Our management from time to time will conduct random
        on site inspections. If, after your inspection, you find our service unsatisfactory, please contact us within 24
        hours so we can correct the issue the next day. Refunds or discounts are not offered as we will try to correct any
        mistakes or missed services. Requests received by our office after that period will be incorporated into your next
        boat cleaning.
      </p>
      <h2 className="my-4">
        THE CLEANING TEAM
      </h2>

      <p>
        We are responsible for all payroll taxes and pay for workman’s compensation insurance. We provide all equipment and 
        supplies. Our employees wear uniforms to identify themselves. Our cleaners usually work in teams of two or more depending 
        on the size of the job. We make every effort to keep the same team leader assigned to your boat, but cannot guarantee it. 
        Illness, vacations, etc, can all result in a change of team or change of detailers on a team.
      </p>
      <h2 className="my-4">
        TRAINING AND SUPERVISION
      </h2>

      <p>
        The owners of Brighton Marine Services LLC actually work on your boat. They are highly trained, experienced and skilled in 
        boat detailing. New detailing members are assigned to trainers who supervise them on their first several detail jobs. After 
        a formal review with the trainer, the cleaner is then assigned to a team or allowed to work on their own.
      </p>
      <h2 className="my-4">
        PREPARING FOR YOUR DETAILING
      </h2>

      <p>
        Prior to the detailing team’s arrival, please remove all items that may delay our detailing service. Storage areas that have 
        a large amount of paperwork for instance will not be detailed. We would appreciate it if items were picked up off the boat deck 
        and the boat was organized before we arrived. This will maximize efficiency and minimize the time we spend to detail your boat. 
        If you prefer that our detailing team remove these items, we will add the additional billing time and charge you accordingly. 
        Also please secure cash, jewelry and other small valuables. If for some reason you do not want a particular area of your boat to 
        be detailed, please just leave a note and secure the hatch to that area of the boat. For safety reasons, we prefer that no one be 
        in the boat while our detailers are present.
      </p>

      <h2 className="my-4">
        SECURITY ALARMS
      </h2>

      <p>
        If your boat is equipped with a security system, please insure that it is in the “OFF” position or inform our office of the codes 
        and input sequence before your scheduled detailing. Please be sure to notify our office if this code changes.
      </p>
      <h2 className="my-4">
        WHAT WE WON’T DO
      </h2>

      <p>
        If we are specifically requested to clean the inside of a storage compartment or boat interior, the client agrees to not hold BMS 
        or any of its employees responsible for damage to any article or component. BMS is not responsible for damage due to faulty and/or 
        improper installation of any item, nor rusting or corrosion of related equipment. Examples would be: broken or improperly installed 
        wiring, broken or frayed dock lines, etc. All surfaces are assumed sealed and ready to detail without causing harm. If you have other 
        items you prefer we not clean or handle, please call or email the office and we will arrange to avoid those items. Our team cannot lift 
        any objects over 20 pounds, so please have these item secured where they belong. The detailing members will only reach the areas on 
        your boat that are humanly possible. If we cannot reach it, then it will not be cleaned. The detailing team will not pull out any 
        appliances (for example a stove, fridge) for you due to the possibility of causing floor damage (unless you hold us blameless for any 
        damage), however if you have these appliances moved out yourself we would be more than happy to clean behind them. The detailing team is 
        also not responsible for mooring, dock lines, or the security of your boat to the dock or to the boat trailer.
      </p>
      <h2 className="my-4">
        ACCIDENTS/DAMAGE
      </h2>
      <p>
        Because of the nature of our business, our staff is required to touch, step on, kneel on, or lean against virtually everything on and in 
        your boat. We are as careful as possible; however, if something does get damaged while detailing your boat, our staff is instructed to 
        call the client at once and to leave a note advising you of the incident. The office will also follow-up with a phone call or email to 
        you to determine the best course of action. We are NOT responsible for your old, rotted, rusty, broken (or on the verge of broken), loose 
        decking, waterlogged decking ribs, corrosion build-up, loose or hanging wires, fishing equipment (old or new), bent transom, bent or broken 
        props, anything 
      </p>
      <h2 className="my-4">
        SCHEDULING & CANCELATION POLICY
      </h2>

      <p>
        All detailing times and schedules are the responsibility of the boat owner. It is the boat owners’ responsibility to provide BMS with the 
        wash/detail schedule in writing via email at least (7) seven days prior to detailing your boat. It is not BMS’s responsibility to find out 
        this information through other sources. BMS requires at least 48 hours notice if there is a change in the scheduling day or time. If our 
        detailers arrive during the requested detailing day and time and they are turned away for ANY reason, or can not gain entrance for ANY 
        reason, the boat owner would still be liable to pay the agreed upon detailing fee. BMS’s Agreement with their detailers specifies they will 
        still be paid in full for that scheduled detailing regardless if they cannot gain entrance. Future scheduled detailing will remain unchanged 
        unless you give us the change in writing via email.
      </p>
      <h2 className="my-4">
        ARRIVAL & DEPARTURE TIME
      </h2>

      <p>
        BMS prefers a window of a minimum of 8 hours to detail your boat and ensure it is properly cleaned. With this said, BMS reserves the right 
        to stay an extra (2) hours after the proposed finish time to detail for ANY reason.
      </p>
      <h2 className="my-4">
        WEATHER
      </h2>

      <p>
        In severe weather, we may determine it is not safe to travel and/or carry equipment and supplies to your boat; therefore your detailing service 
        for that day will be cancelled and BMS will not be held liable in anyway. If and when this occurs, we will reschedule in writing via email or 
        phone call.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="my-4">
        EXTRA REQUESTS
      </h2>

      <p>
        Please email us at least (2) two days before your scheduled detailing if you have special requests (e.g. after painting, sanding), detailed hull 
        cleaning, windows, etc. so we can schedule the extra time needed to complete these tasks. We can provide an over the phone estimate; however, we 
        reserve the right to adjust the quote once we have arrived at the boat. Any alterations or changes from our “standard” detailing checklist involving 
        extra work will be at an extra charge. Any “last minute/emergency” visits are also an extra charge. Any extra charges must be approved in writing via 
        email, text or phone call between you and BMS before any extra work begins.
      </p>

      <h2 className="my-4">
        PAYMENT POLICY
      </h2>

      <p>
        Payment is due in full upon completion of the job and receiving a written signature of satisfaction. A 50% deposit is required on all jobs exceeding $1,000. 
        A fee of $30.00 will be charged for each NSF check returned by the bank. In the event an account requires legal or collection action, client/boat owner agrees 
        to pay all costs of collection without limitations for reasonable attorney fees, interest on past due amount, court costs, and all collection costs. Moreover, 
        BMS reserves the right to place a lien and or a judgment upon your boat for a delinquent payment and you, the boat owner, agree to pay all legal fees and time 
        spent for remedy. Please do not leave any payments on the boat. For accounting purposes, we prefer payments to be made directly to Brighton Marine Services LLC 
        via check and/or PayPal. Please send PayPal payments as a “personal transaction.” With this said, if you choose to use Paypal by any other payment method (e.g. 
        Instant Transfer) a fee will be charged to BMS and we will need to pass this fee on to you on your next detail visit.
      </p>

      <h2 className="my-4">
        LATE FEE
      </h2>

      <p>
        Overdue payments are subject to a late fee of $25.00 for accounts overdue by 30 days. In addition, interest will be charged at the rate of twelve percent (12%) 
        per annum on all overdue amounts accruing monthly.
      </p>


      <h2 className="my-4">
        GRATUITY
      </h2>

      <p>
        Although a gratuity is not expected or required, the detail team members certainly welcome it! A great way to show the team your appreciation is with a gratuity. 
        The amount of gratuity is split equally among the members of the team. You may leave a cash gratuity for the team (preferred method) or add the gratuity to your 
        payment by specifying the amount on the check. Gratuities will not be accepted on credit card or PayPal.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="my-4">
        DETERMINING THE COST OF YOUR DETAILING
      </h2>

      <p>
        BMS must conduct a walk-through before they can give you a quote in writing. However, after the first or subsequent detail job, if BMS determines they need to adjust 
        the detailing fee higher, we will email you or call with the new dollar amount. You have the option of not agreeing to the increase and void this Agreement.
      </p>

      <h2 className="my-4">
        HIRING OF BMS STAFF
      </h2>

      <p>
        All of our detailers have signed a “Non-Compete Agreement” with BMS. Therefore they are prohibited from soliciting business from any client on his/her own behalf 
        or on behalf of any third party during their employment with BMS or for (5) five years following leaving or termination of employment, without written approval 
        from BMS. Therefore, you agree not to hire past or present cleaning team members of BMS for a period of not less than 5 years from the date the team member last 
        worked for BMS. A great deal of time and resources are put into hiring our staff. However, in the event you feel you must hire a team member of BMS in spite of 
        this agreement, then a $2,500.00 placement fee is due immediately upon employment of the past/present team member, regardless of whether the employment is regular 
        or on a contract basis. In this event and payment is not received within 30 days of written notice and an account requires legal or collection action, client/boat 
        owner agrees to pay all cost of collection without limitations for reasonable attorney fees, interest on past due amount, court costs, and all collection costs. 
        Moreover, BMS reserves the right to place a lien and or a judgment upon your boat for a delinquent payment and you, the boat owner, agrees to pay all legal fees 
        and time spent for remedy.
